# Asynchronous Javascript and XML

-- Originally created by Microsoft... ActiveX

-- Netscape had been working on something similar, they called theirs XMLHttpRequest object

-- In the past we needed to determine browser... if it was XMLHttpRequest capable, then we created a new XMLHttpRequest object, otherwise, we created a new ActiveX object... they both behaved exactly the same.


-- Where did the term Ajax come from

-- Microsoft started using it for Hotmail

-- Google followed with the GMAIL suite... google docs, spreadsheets.  

-- Term Ajax was coined by Jesse James Garret at a company Adaptive Path

-- jQuery really brought Ajax to the forefront for front end developers...
