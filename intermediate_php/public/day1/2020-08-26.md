## vhost file for XAMPP

Located here:  `C:\xampp\apache\conf\extra`

Your DocumentRoot and Directory path would be different, of course

```apache

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName intermediatephp.local
    DocumentRoot "D:/htdocs/intermediate_php/wdd7/public"
    <Directory "D:/htdocs/intermediate_php/wdd7/public">
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        require all granted
    </Directory>
    ErrorLog "logs/error.log"
    CustomLog "logs/access.log" common
</VirtualHost>

```


## MySQL Monitor Commands

Note: If you're working with MySQL, you may have better luck using Windows PowerShell than Bash or CMD.

Open a windows power shell anywhere:   SHIFT right click 'Open Power Shell here'

From Bash or Power Shell, these commands are useful:

```bash

# Open mysql as root user
mysql -u root

# Open mysql as another user with a password
mysql -u username -p 

# Backup a database to a backup file
# mysqldump -u [username] -p [databasename] > [backupfile]
# eg:
mysqldump -u web_user -p booksite > backup.sql 


# Read in a database backup file
# Note: you should add lines at the start of the file to 
# DROP the database
# CREATE the database
# USE the database
mysql -u web_user -p < backup.sql

```

You can also import backup files from within mysql monitor.  The following commands can be executed AFTER opening mysql monitor.  Assumes `backup.sql` is in the same folder form which you started MySQL:


```sql

use databasename;

source backup.sql

```

When you create a database in MySQL, you always want to create user who has access to that database.  Follow these commands from INSIDE mysql.

```sql

CREATE DATABASE databasename;

CREATE USER 'username'@'localhost' identified by 'somepassword';

GRANT ALL ON databasename.* to 'username'@'localhost';

-- So, for example:

-- Create database if you don't have one already
CREATE DATABASE booksite;

CREATE USER 'book_user'@'localhost' identified by 'mypass2020!';

GRANT ALL ON booksite.* TO 'book_user'@'localhost';

-- OR (in one statement)

GRANT ALL on booksite.* to 'book_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypass';

```

Remember, on Ubuntu (DigitalOcean, Amazon)... there IS NO ROOT USER for MySQL.

To use mysql as the root user, login  like this:


```bash

# Login to mysql as root user
sudo mysql

```

These commands will also work on your DigitalOcean Droplet or Amazon ECT Server.   Follow these steps.

1. Make a MySQL dump locally in your project repository
2. Git add commit and push to origin master
3. SSH into your server, and CD to your project repository
4. Execute: `git pull` to sync with origin master
5. CD to the folder with the mysqldump
6. Run one of the import commands above, either from the shell, or from within mysql
    - eg, from shell: mysql -u username -p < backup.sql
    - eg, from inside mysql:  source backup.sql

## Running PHP from the Shell


You can run any PHP file simply by executing it in the shell:

```bash
# Output will be directly into the bash shell
php test.php
```

You can also run PHP interactively:

```bash
php -a
```

PHP has a built-in server, for quickly testing files.  The only issues are:

* It's not a full-fledge server... doesn't have all the features of apache
* Requires and index file, or it will give you a 404 error

```bash
php -S localhost:8000

# To close the server, click on the shell window, type ctrl-C
```
