You might have to do this on your server

```bash
cd /var
sudo chown -R username.www-data www
chmod -R 775 www
chmod -R g+s www
```


<?php

// create an associative user array with string keys
// Add five or six fields
// name = Dave jones
// email = dave@example.com

$user = array(
    'name' => 'Dave'
);

// save the user array as a cookie named user

```php

// The session is shared storage between request
// Data can be shared from page to page
// As long as the session is started on each page.
// 
// That's why we start session in a central file
// that is required by each page: eg config.php


// Important points
// 
// 1. The user cannot ever see session data -- it's not accessible 
// to the browser.  It's secure.  Only your application has access
// to it.  In other words, it can be trusted... as long as you trust
// the data you put into it
// 
// 2. PHP connects the user's browser to the shared storage, by
// setting SESSION cookie in the browser.  The browser cookie
// contains a key.  When PHP receives that cookie during the 
// request, it can retrieve all session that is associated with
// that key, and place it in the $_SESSION SuperGlobal.
// 
// 3. Difference between a cookie that stores data, and sessoin
// data... cookie data is stored in the browser, so the user can
// see it and manipulate it.  Session data is stored on the server,
// and can ony be manipulated by the app (the programmer)
// 
// 4. If the user disables cookies, or deletes his PHPSESSID cookie,
// the connection between the browser and saved data is LOST permanently
//
//
